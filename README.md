# PowerPoints

I was often asked during, or after, one of my presentations if I would give someone the actual PowerPoint deck that I used during the presentation. Most of the time, I would just send them a PDF copy of the presentation, which was fine for more cases.

But, I got to thinking lately that maybe some of this material is useful for other purposes, which is where we find ourselves now.

Some of this material is dated, some of actually quite new and still relevant to the current version of Dynamics 365, Power Platform, DataVerse, etc.

These presentations (over 100 in all), represent nine years of delivering training, conducting webinars, and speaking at conferences.

I should also note there are a few presentations on Xamarin mobile development, which I was doing for a while.

Please enjoy and use as you see fit.

Thanks, Mitch
